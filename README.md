# hello-world
My first repository

Hello, github!

I'm Coding Pasta. I'm new to coding, and to github. I'm hoping to learn what web development is while I'm here by collaborating on with others and working on my own projects.
I've loved writing code since writing my first code on c++ in turbo. The idea of writing a code and making it into a software that people will find helpful is enough to make me want to go this path. Also, the idea of creating something out of my own ideas is refreshing. I wish to always feel that way.
